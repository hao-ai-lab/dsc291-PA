An interesting aspect of NumPy is how it handles zero-rank arrays. For example, adding two zero-rank arrays (`np.array(1) + np.array(2)`) produces a scalar value instead of another zero-rank array:\n","```\n",">>> x = np.array(1)\n",">>> y = np.array(2)\n",">>> type(x), type(y), x.ndim, y.ndim\n","(<class 'numpy.ndarray'>, <class 'numpy.ndarray'>, 0, 0)\n",">>> z = x + y\n",">>> z, type(z)\n","(3, <class 'numpy.int64'>)\n","```\n","For a thorough implementation, you would need to ensure that results are wrapped back into `numpy.ndarray` types. However, for simplicity, this adjustment is optional in this homework. No tests will check for this behavior, and it will not impact your grade. Python does not enforce eager type checking for scalar values.\n","\n","2. **`Node.attrs`.** In our reference implementation of `AddByConstOp` in `auto_diff.py`, the `attrs` field stores the constant operand of the addition. Generally, the `attrs` field holds all **constants** known at the time of constructing the computational graph. For instance, in `AddByConstOp`, the constant operand is stored as a node attribute, whereas in `MatMulOp`, attributes like boolean flags for transposing input matrices are used. You might find it beneficial to store the reduction axis as an attribute when implementing operations like `SumOp`.\n","\n","3. **Minimality of `gradients`.** The `gradients` function builds the backward graph and returns gradient nodes for the specified nodes. It's worth noting that it's not mandatory to construct a minimal backward graph, which would only include necessary gradient nodes. For instance, in the graph `y = x1 * x2 + x1`, if we only require the gradient for `x1 * x2`, a minimal backward graph would exclusively involve this gradient. While this homework doesn't require constructing minimal backward graphs, contemplating the potential advantages or disadvantages of such an approach is a valuable exercise.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZaOoXdqQyfKV"},"source":["## Part 2: SGD for logistic regression (40 pt)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","In this section, you are to implement the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm to train a straightforward logistic regression model.\n","\n","Consider an input vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.
